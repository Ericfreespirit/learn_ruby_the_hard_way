Some commands for files:

- `close` -- Closes the files.
- `read` -- Reads the contents of the files. You can assign the result to a variable.
- `readline` -- Reads just one line of a text file.
- `truncate`-- Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.
- `write('stuff')` -- Writes "stuff" to the file
- `seek(0)`-- Move the read/write location to the beginning of the file.
